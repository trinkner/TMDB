				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					Nancy White was born in Boone County, Missouri about 19 March 1818. On September 11, 1836, when she was 16, she married Rev. Richard Buckham, M.D., who had recently come to Missouri from Kentucky. By 1842, they had moved to Atchison county, Missouri. Together, they had seven children.
					</p>
					<p>
					Although Nancy was married to a highly literate and educated man, she could neither read nor write. She was, however quite resourceful. She worked as a homemaker, which in remote Atchison in the 1840s would have been challenging, and required Nancy to learn new kitchen techniques and also to learn a bit of the Indian languages. According to her daughter Susan, "there were so few vegetables at first that [Nancy] used to dry pumpkin and cut it in strips, then cook it in different ways to give variety to the diet. But there was plenty of wild fruit - plums, blackberries, raspberries, and grapes. We did not know how to can, but made some preserves, using brown sugar. White sugar, which came in loaves, was only used when there was company."
					</p>
					<p>
					Susan also remembered episodes when Nancy made lard from the pigs that were a new introduction to Atchison life, introduced by Richard. "[Richard] had gone to Savannah, Missouri and brought back the first pigs in the country. When the Indians found that lard was being made, they came in droves to trade for it. [Nancy] had more lard than containers, so the Indians would cut off a piece of a tree, scoop it out and put the lard in that, then they would squat down on the ground in a circle, and put their fingers in the lard an lick it off their fingers. [Nancy] used to get provoked at the Indians because they stole something every time they came. She would say "puckachee" to them, which means "go!," but they were never unfriendly."
					</p>
					<p>
					Nancy often received innovative gifts from Richard, which his physician's wages could afford. According to Susan, Nancy's kitchen had "the first cook-stove (in) the country. People came for miles around to see it, and they said it would not work. Sure enough, it did not work until about three weeks later it was discovered that the draft was closed. He also brought the first sewing machine to Atchison county, and it attracted people from all around. A coffee-grinder and flour-sifter" in Nancy's kitchen were also great curiosities.
					</p>
					<p>
					Susan was a lifelong member of the Christian Church since she was a small girl, so it is likely that Nancy, too, was a member of the Christian Church. She died on August 11, 1852, when she was only about 32.
