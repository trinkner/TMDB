				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					Richard Buckham was a physician, preacher, cabinet maker, state legislator and a man fond of innovations. Although he worked hard to establish a life in the remote frontier county of Atchison, Missouri, he insisted often on observing the formality of his native Kentucky's society. He experienced the growth of the country as it expanded westward, he helped develop and spread medical knowledge by publishing his findings, and he witnessed the events of the nineteenth century and the changing of America -- knowing Indians around his frontier home, having a son-in-law fight as a colonel in the Civil War, and enjoying the consumer prosperity of the latter half of the 1800s. He also witnessed the changing of the medical profession from one of apprenticeships and herbal remedies to one of university training and professional publications.
					</p>
					<p>
					Rev. Richard Buckham, M.D. was born in Sumner County, Tennessee, June 25, 1811. His father, Andrew Buckham, was born in Scotland, and his mother, whose maiden name was Charlotte Taylor, was from Maryland, but of Welsh parentage. While Richard was in his infancy they moved to Hopkins County, Kentucky where he was brought up and received a "good English education." Richard 's father was a cabinet-maker. From his father, Richard learned the cabinet-maker's trade.
					</p>
					<p>
					Richard married Nancy White, from Boone County, Missouri, on September 11, 1836. They had seven children. Susan Ann, the wife of Colonel P.A. Thompson; Lottie, who married Robert Hunter, of Rock Port; Dr Robert Buckham, an excellent physician who died in Atchison county May 29, 1879; Martha who married to a Mr Boley in 1868 and died March 28, 1879, leaving one child, Ena, a bright little girl, whom Richard Buckham brought up as his own daughter.
					</p>
					<p>
					In 1838, while in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, he was ordained to preach in the Christian church by Elder Collins. He studied medicine with a prominent physician of Union County, Kentucky, in 1838, and practiced this profession for many years. In 1872 he received a diploma in medicine, when, on account of his long experience and being an able contributor to the medical journals, the Physic Medical Institutes, of Cincinnati, Ohio, awarded him a diploma which was "well earned and worthily bestowed."
					</p>
					<p>
					Richard and Nancy traveled from Kentucky by river to Weston, Missouri, and first settled in Fremont county, Iowa, thinking he was in Missouri. Then his brother came out from Kentucky and took over the Iowa land which Richard had "proved up." Richard and his family moved to a place north of Rock Port known as the Warneke farm. He settled in in Atchison county in May, 1842.
					</p>
					<p>
					In Missouri, Richard worked primarily as a physician, but also preached on Sundays. His daughter, Susan, said that he "preached on Sundays, though he would never take a charge. He wore a Prince Albert coat and looked almost as well as he had in Kentucky. He brought a box of shoe-blacking from Kentucky and we all had to black our shoes on Sunday mornings. When the blacking was gone, we used lamp-black. He made most of his medicines from herbs, as he had been taught to do. He would treat a patient, and if the patient was unfortunate enough to die, he would make his coffin and preach the funeral sermon. I remember seeing him make my mother's coffin, which he covered with black cloth and trimmed with black silk lace. In those days a coffin was not placed in a box, but was lowered in to the grave in a sheet."
					</p>
					<p>
					With his physician's wages, Richard often purchased innovative household technologies and brought them them to the family's remote home in Atchison county. His daughter Susan said, "Father brought the first cook-stove into the country. People came for miles around to see it, and they said it would not work. Sure enough, it did not work until about three weeks later it was discovered that the draft was closed. He also brought the first sewing machine to Atchison county, and it attracted people from all around. A coffee-grinder and flour-sifter that he brought also were great curiosities."
					</p>
					<p>
					According to the Atchison County Journal, "Dr. Richard Buckham performed the first marriage ceremony, preached the first funeral sermon and officiate at the birth of the first white child born in the county, and that boy was William Millsap, still a resident of the county. Dr. "Dick", as he was best known, belonged to the Thompsonian school of physicians and had great faith in lobelia No. 6 and ginger tea. He was a Christian preacher and a farmer and a stockraiser and also a Republican politician and represented Atchison county in the Missouri legislature later."
					</p>
					<p>
					Despite working as a physician and preacher, he tended some of his own animals, and here too he was innovative for the county. Accordingn to Susan, he "went to Savannah, Missouri, and brought back the first pigs in the country. When the Indians found that lard was being made, they came in droves to trade for it. My mother had more lard than containers, so the Indians would cut off a piece of a tree, scoop it out and put the lard in that, then they would squat down on the ground in a circle, and put their fingers in the lard an lick it off their fingers. My mother used to get provoked at the Indians because they stole something every time they came. She would say 'puckachee' to them, which means 'go!,' but they were never unfriendly."
					</p>
					<p>
					His wife Nancy died August 11, 1852. A year later, he later married Julia Ann Gray Baird, on July 24, 1853, and by this union they had three daughters: Ida L. Joslin, Laura T.L. and Effie Everett. Julia, by her former marriage had four children: Frances N., Martha Bell,George S. and Emma J., who married James Wade, of Phelps City. When they married, Ricahrd and Julia each had a son and three daughters about, and these they brought up together, each one's children always treating and regarding the other as their own brothers and sisters.
					</p>
					<p>
					Richard owned 470 acres of land in Atchison, Missouri. 1850 census listed the value of his real estate at $2,000. He died in 1896, at the age of 85. His daughter, Susan, was a member of the Chrisitan Church since she was a girl, which implies that Richard was also a member of the protestant Christian Church.
