				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					John Gardiner Telford witnessed much of the sadness of 19th-century social history and experienced first-hand the large-scale movements of people across borders and within the United States. Raised in a wealthy Protestant land-owning family in central Ireland, he lived through the Irish potato famine, immigrated to the U.S. during the Civil War, married a woman in the American South, lived in both Canada and upstate New York, and lost his young wife to tuberculosis. After her death, he sent their three children to live with his sister and mother in Dublin while he returned to America. During his 50s and 60s, he lived as a bachelor boarder in rural upstate New York, and ultimately died in Liverpool, England.
					</p>
					<p>
					John was born to wealthy Protestant Irish parents in December 1842 in Ireland at the small estate of Ballyboughlin near Tullamore in what was then called King's County, just south of the present-day border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, southwest of Belfast. The potato famine struck Ireland in 1847 and lasted for several years, so John's childhood was probably significantly affected by the famine. His father, John Telford, owned, rented, and managed a wide portfolio of property in the Tullamore area, including a modest manor house, a mill, and several farms. Despite having eight siblings, only two were alive by the time John Gardiner reached adulthood. His brother Thomas became a physician, but died in 1874 at the age of 31. John's surviving sister, Anna, would live as a spinster in Dublin until her death in 1928. His father died when John was 14. John Gardiner always used his middle name or initial in official documents, suggesting that he used his middle name to distinguish himself from his father, John, who had no middle name. It's possible that John Gardiner went by "J.G.," as several documents refer to him by that name.
					</p>
					<p>
					When John was about 20, he left the family home, quite possibly being sent away because of wild behavior or troubles with alcohol. Victorian Britain used the phrase "remittance men" to describe men from wealthy families who left their family homes to live in the colonies or elsewhere, often because of legal or behavioral troubles. They were supported by remittances from their families, often to keep the men away from the family where their troubles could embarrass the family. This term may well apply to John, as he was described as "wild" by a contemporary and seems to have suffered from alcoholism during at least some part of his life. He was secured financially by his family. Not only did he own land in Ireland (and presumably received rents from that land), but his brother and sister established annuities for him which were worth in 1905. These three annuities, adjusted for inflation, would provide an annual sum of over in 2013 pounds, in addition to whatever payment he received from the ownership of land.
					</p>
					<p>
					Although the reasons for his leaving Ireland remain murky, he immigrated to the US in the early 1860s and largely lived out the rest of his life in the US and Canada. Shortly after arriving, he enlisted in the Union Army, fighting in the American Civil War. It's not known which unit he served with or for how long he served. By the 1870s, however, he lived in Louisiana in the American South. This was the time of "Reconstruction," a fiercely contested political and social struggle to reshape Southern society after the emancipation of the slaves. Perhaps John had traveled to Louisiana to seek opportunity in the changing economy there, or perhaps he worked for a federal agency to enforce the new laws of reconstruction. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, northern soldiers garrisoned areas of the south under fedearl policies which divided the Southern states into five military districts until these states satisfied the North's requirements for re-entering the union; perhaps John served as a soldier in one such garrison.
					</p>
					<p>
					By 1876 John had met Eliza Jane Blue in Louisiana. She was born in Alabama in 1853, and grew up partly in Texas, where she lived after her parents died when she was very young. She lived her young adult life in Louisiana, probably near Monroe, not far from the Texas border. She considered herself of Scottish heritage and descended from Argyle who settled in North Carolina in the late 1700s. She identified herself as a Baptist on the 1881 Canadian census. By 1870, Eliza Jane was living in Girard, Louisiana in 1870, near Monroe, as a 17-year-old single boarder, living in the same neighborhood as three Wynn brothers. Since Eliza Jane's mother's maiden name was Wynn, these brothers may have been her uncles.
					</p>
					<p>
					John and Eliza Jane married on 9 March 1874 in Richland, Louisiana, in the extreme north-west of the state. Eliza gave birth to Thomas Fletcher Telford, in 1876 in or near Monroe, Louisiana. Family notes suggest Eliza Jane gave birth to an older child, William, before 1876, but this child must have died within his first years of life.
					</p>
					<p>
					By 1877, John, Eliza Jane and Thomas Fletcher had moved to Toronto, Canada. Many Irish-born families moved to Canada during this time, and the Canadian census indicates that John and Eliza lived in a neighborhood with other Irish immigrants. If John had been a northern soldier, and Eliza a southern woman, it may have been convenient for them to leave the South to avoid social pressures. While in Toronto, Eliza Jane gave birth to two daughters: Annie Lavrock and Alice.
					</p>
					<p>
					In 1879, John traveled from Ireland to the U.S. aboard the passenger ship "Gallia," arriving back in New York on 11 November. He likely traveled back to Ireland, perhaps to help his sister make arrangements after the death of his brother who died in 1874. He would travel back to Britain several times over the rest of his life.
					</p>
					<p>
					Bee's notes suggest that Eliza Jane died of tuberculosis in Arkansas and that she had chosen to travel to the South to be with the Wynn family while she died. Tuberculosis patients often moved south to warmer weather, although they often moved to drier climates than Louisiana or Arkansas. I can find no record of TB sanitaria in Arkansas in the late 1800s. There were tuberculosis sanitariums built in Louisiana, although they mostly were built after 1888 when Eliza died. Eliza Jane's mother's maiden name was Wynn, so perhaps Eliza Jane traveled there to die in the more comfortable southern climate with in-laws.
					</p>
					<p>
					In 1884, newspapers around the US reported that John was robbed on a train of $17,500 in cash while returning from Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The newspapers reported that a policeman on the train recovered the money and returned it to John on board the train. $17,500 in 1884 would be the equivalent of about $440,000 in 2012 dollars, adjusted for inflation, which is certainly a lot of cash to carry aboard a train. The newspapers reported that John was about to return to Ireland. It is likely that this trip to Pine Bluff was the last time that he saw his wife and just before he took his children to Ireland.
					</p>
					<p>
					After taking his wife to Arkansas, John took their three children to Dublin, Ireland, where they lived with his sister and mother, Anna Telford and Jane Maria (Fletcher) Telford. Anna never married, and by the late 1800s she was John's sole living sibling. The Telford women employed a servant, Bessie Hicks, who would help raise the children and remained under Anna's employ until Anna's death in 1928. John returned from Ireland to New York in 1886, likely the trip on which he took his children to Dublin. He may have been in Ireland from 1884 to 1886, as the robbery article indicated that he was returning to Ireland in 1884.
					</p>
					<p>
					Sadly, his youngest daughter, Annie, died in Dublin in 1888 of tuberculosis. His son, Thomas Fletcher, attended boarding school in Shropshire and then attended college and medical school in Dublin, graduating in 1902 before serving in the Boer Wars as a surgeon. John's remaining child, Alice, grew up with Anna in Dublin, and married the Irishman James Arthur Thompson in 1906.
					</p>
					<p>
					In 1905, John returned to Ireland to sign three of his annuities to his sister, Anna. As said above, these annuities paid annual amounts derived from land rent on properties owned in Ireland. He stipulated that upon her death, the annuities should be shared equally between his remaining two children, Alice and Thomas Fletcher. A 1923 Irish law required that lands leased in perpetuity to Protestant land holders be sold. The residual amounts for the Telford properties were ultimately divided between Alice and Thomas Fletcher after Aunt Anna passed away.
					</p>
					<p>
					By 1906, none of John's children remained in Ireland. Thomas Fletcher had moved permanently to establish a medical practice in New Zealand, and Alice had moved permanently to England with her husband who also became a physician.
					</p>
					<p>
					After returning from Ireland to America, John eventually moved just south across the U.S. border to upstate New York. He farmed at Windsor near Niagara Falls on an 800-acre farm. For about 10 years, he lived as a boarder and farm worker in Lewiston, Niagara, New York with the Condren family. In the 1900, 1905, and 1910 census records for Niagara, John was listed with this family. This family was headed by Matthew Condren and his wife Bridget. They had several children. Matthew's brother, Patrick Condren, also lived with them. The family lived on Lower Mountain Road in Lewiston, Niagara, New York. During this time, John listed his profession as a Gentleman (1900), Farm Laborer (1905), and Laborer doing "Odd Jobs" in 1910. In the 1915 New York state census, neither John nor Matthew Condren were living with the Condren family. Instead, Patrick is listed as the head of family, living with Bridget and her children. Likely, Matthew died between 1910 and 1915, and John moved away.
					</p>
					<p>
					John died on 2 December 1918, just a few weeks after the end of the first world war, of apoplexy at the age of 76 in Liverpool, England. His death certificate listed him as a railway worker, but one of "independent means," suggesting that some of the Telford wealth may have followed him despite his unusual travels and living arrangements. On the other hand, his sister Anna Telford owed over in duties due to his death. Whether those duties were death taxes, burial fees, or debts is not clear. He is buried at Allerton Cemetery in Liverpool, England. His burial record and death certificate indicate that his last abode was at 8 Edgerton Road, Wavertree, Liverpool. His cemetery plot was purchased by Margaret Hearnden, the same woman who was listed as the witness to his death on his death certificate. Margaret elsewhere listed her profession as a "temperance hotel worker," suggesting that John may have struggled with alcoholism.
					</p>
					<p>
					Did John suffer from alcoholism? We may never know, but several pieces of information point in that direction. An Irish letter describing the family referred to John as "wild." This wildness, or alcoholism, may have caused the family to send him away from Ireland as a "remittance man." The annuities established by his siblings for him support this idea. He sent his children back to Ireland after his wife died, rather than remarrying or caring for his children himself, although he seems to have had sufficient financial means to raise them. Perhaps he realized that alcoholism prevented him from caring for his children. At the end of his life, he was associated with Margaret Hearnden in Liverpool. Margaret was a temperance hotel worker. She was present at his death and helped establish his burial, which suggests that John was associated with a temperance hotel. Perhaps John tried throughout his life to combat alcoholism. John's son, Thomas Fletcher, refused to drink alcohol, despite having no religious objections. Thomas Fletcher also urged his daughter, Bee, never to drink. Perhaps alcoholic experiences of his father left a scarring impression. Lastly, John's wife, Eliza Jane, was a Baptist, and on the Canadian census their children are all listed as Baptists. Since Baptists traditionally have opposed alcohol, it's possible that her husband's alcoholism led her to instill anti-alcohol views in her children.
