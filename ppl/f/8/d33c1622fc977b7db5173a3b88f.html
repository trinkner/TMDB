				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					Thomas and Anne Brownell were the first members of the Brownell family to emigrate to America. Most Brownells in the United States and Canada are descended from them. They arrived in New England in 1638, on board the "Whale." According to the ship's passenger list, they had lived in the London parish of St. Mary Cole before making the journey to America.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thomas and Anne are assumed to be the Thomas Brownell and Anne Bourne who were married in the Church of St. Benet's, Paul's Wharf, on 20 March 1637/1638.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thomas is also tentatively identified as the Thomas Brownell baptized at St. Mary's Church in Rawmarsh, Yorkshire, England, on 5 June 1608. He is also assumed to be the son of Robert and Mary (Wilson) Brownell. He had an older brother, George, baptized at St. Mary's on 23 March 1606, and a younger sister, Anne, baptized on 28 July 1611.
					</p>
					<p>
					Anne has been tentatively identified as the daughter of Richard and Judith (Cowper) Bourne, born in London and baptized at St. Michael Cornhill on 15 February 1606.
					</p>
					<p>
					Both Thomas and his brother, George, apparently left Yorkshire at some point and went to London, where they probably worked as drapers (dealers in cloth or clothing and dry goods) for their uncle, Thomas Wilson. Known as Thomas Wilson The Elder, he was the brother of Mary (Wilson) Brownell and was a prosperous cloth worker or fabric merchant in London. He also owned a very large estate called Ryecroft, near Rawmarsh where both he and Mary Wilson were born.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thomas and Anne Brownell settled first in Mt. Wollaston (later known as Braintree) Massachusetts, where Thomas was a "planter" or farmer. The first record of him there is in the notebook or legal memoranda of Thomas Lechford. He sold "a house, a garden and six acres of arable land in Braintree" to Deodatus Curtis. The deed is undated, but occurs between entries of 26 May and 11 June 1640.
					</p>
					<p>
					The only other record of Thomas Brownell in Braintree is in the Notarial Record of William Aspinwall on 22 February 1646. The record states that "I Thomas Brownell do acknowledge myself indebted to Robert Kearne in the just sum of 1 pound 12 shillings and 4 pence which I promise to pay to the said Robert or his assigns in his now dwelling house in Boston at or before 1 July (?)."
					</p>
					<p>
					This second record could imply that the Brownells lived in Braintree until 1646. It is more likely, however, that this was an old debt and that the Brownells left Braintree in 1640 when the house and land we resold.
					</p>
					<p>
					Mary, the eldest of Thomas and Anne Brownell's nine children, was probably born during the time they lived in Braintree. Her date of birth is given as April 1639. There is, however, no record of this birth as the recording of births in Braintree did not begin until 1643 and were very sketchy for the early years, few births being actually recorded. Coincidentally, the first birth recorded in Braintree was that of Solomon Curtis, the son of Deodatus Curtis and his wife Rebecca, in 1643. If the Brownells lived in Braintree until 1646, two additional children would have been born there-Sarah ca. 1641 and Martha 1 May 1643. Neither birth is recorded there or elsewhere.
					</p>
					<p>
					Two years after arriving in America and making their home in Braintree, MA, Thomas and Anne Brownell sold their house and land there and, with their one-year-old daughter, Mary, moved again. This time they chose the recently settled town of Portsmouth, Rhode Island.
					</p>
					<p>
					Portsmouth had been established in 1638 by supporters of Anne Hutchinson who had been banished from Boston after being found guilty of heresy and excommunicated from the Boston Church. With the help of Roger Williams the Island of Aquidneck was purchased from the Indians and a settlement was established at an area called Pocasset. The name was changed to Portsmouth the following year.
					</p>
					<p>
					It was among these "heretics" that Thomas and Anne chose to make their permanent home in America. While there are no records which state that the Brownells moved to Portsmouth in 1640, the record of the sale of their house in Braintree in 1640 would make that a logical conclusion. Furthermore, the remaining eight of their nine children are said to have been born in Portsmouth although, as in Braintree, there are no records to substantiate this.
					</p>
					<p>
					The first written record of Thomas Brownell in Portsmouth is in 1647 when he was a witness to the will of his neighbor, John Walker, on 18 March 1647 O.S.[1] Through this will and from depositions taken in 1721 for a court case involving Walker's land, the location of the Brownell farm has been determined. It was on the western side of the northwestern end of Rhode Island. (The island, formerly known as Aquidneck Island, which is now Newport County and on which both Portsmouth and Newport are located is officially known as Rhode Island.) The farm, comprised of forty acres, extended down to the water and looked out on Narragansett Bay. There is still today a road named "Brownell Lane" at this location.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thomas Brownell held a number of public offices for the town of Portsmouth. This was not unusual, because of the large number of offices to be filled and the limited number of Freemen to fill those offices, many were elected to one office or another almost every year. Finding someone who would accept an office was often difficult. Portsmouth, as well as other towns in Rhode Island, imposed fines not only on those Freemen who didn't attend town meetings, but also on those who refused to accept the office to which they were elected.
					</p>
					<p>
					On 10 July 1648 Thomas was chosen at the town meeting for the post of"water bailey," a position which gave him jurisdiction over fisheries and other maritime matters. He was often chosen to serve on various juries, as were most of the Freemen of Portsmouth.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thomas is said to have been made a Freeman of Portsmouth in 1655, but it is more likely that his name appeared on a list of Freemen for that year. He had probably been a Freeman since shortly after moving to Portsmouth and at the latest by 1648. It is unlikely that he would have been elected to an office such as water bailey had he not been a Freeman, i.e. able to vote and to participate in the local government. Church membership was not a prerequisite for being a Freeman in Portsmouth as it had been in Braintree.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thomas was chosen on 5 May 1655 to be of six Commissioners to represent Portsmouth at the General Court in Providence. The General Court served as a kind of legislative body for the colony, which at that time consisted of the towns of Portsmouth, Newport, Providence and Warwick. The location of the Court's meetings alternated among the four towns.
					</p>
					<p>
					Later in the same year, on 4 June 1655, Thomas was elected one of three constables for the town of Portsmouth. On 29 September 1662 he was again chosen as a Commissioner to the General Court which was to beheld in Warwick and was also chosen to be on the Grand Jury for the Court of Trials in Warwick. Thomas was chosen once again on 27 April1664 as a Commissioner to the General Court to be held at Newport.
					</p>
					<p>
					At the General Court of Trials held at Warwick, Rhode Island, on 11 March 1655 O.S. a jury heard a case between the state and Caleb Carr about a sheep that Thomas Brownell "Challengeth." The verdict of the jury was that Caleb Carr was "clear" or not guilty.[10] At the same session of the General Court, Thomas accused John Coggeshall "upon suspicion of Felony of an Ewe sheep." He was ordered to post a bond of £100 to prosecute Coggeshall, who was ordered to post the same bond to answer the charge at the General Court of Trials at Providence. A jury heard the case on 24 June 1656 and found the charges against Coggeshall to be not true. The case was ended by the consents of both parties in open court and Thomas was released from his £100 bond.
					</p>
					<p>
					Thomas was involved in a more significant controversy in 1661. A dispute had arisen between Thomas and John Porter over a small parcel of land. At the town meeting on 11 May 1661 a committee of five men was established to settle the dispute which concerned the boundary between the two men's properties. Since these kinds of disputes were constantly arising, the town meeting further ordered that this same committee would hear all similar disputes and report their results to the town meeting.
					</p>
					<p>
					This case was cited as a precedence in a similar dispute in 1673 between Sarah Smiton (probably the mother of the Sarah Smiton who married Thomas Brownell's son William in 1672) and Thomas Jennings. Three of the five original committee members were still alive and, with two more added, their power to make decisions in boundary disputes was confirmed by the town meeting.
					</p>
					<p>
					The resolution of the dispute between Thomas Brownell and John Porter was reported to the town meeting on 1 October 1661. The result established the boundary line between the two properties. Without an understanding of the area at that time, however, it is impossible to determine which party was the winner in this dispute.
					</p>
					<p>
					On the afternoon of 24 September 1664, Thomas Brownell was killed in an accident while on his way from his farm at the northwest end of Rhode Island to Portsmouth. (The Brownells, as was typical of most settlers at that time, probably did not live on their farm. They would also have had a small lot in Portsmouth where they built their home and lived, going to their farm during the day to work.) Aged 56, Thomas left behind a wife, Anne, and nine children, ranging in age from nine to twenty-five years.
					</p>
					<p>
					According to the testimony of Daniel Lawton, Brownell had stopped at the home of Lawton's father, Thomas Lawton, and upon leaving, invited Daniel, aged 21, to ride with him the rest of the way to Portsmouth. The ride soon became a race when Thomas put his horse to a gallop as they came down the hill near William Wodel's property, located about halfway between the Brownell farm and the town of Portsmouth. The younger man soon caught up with and passed Thomas.
					</p>
					<p>
					As he continued the race to Portsmouth, Lawton looked back to see where Brownell was. Seeing his riderless horse running towards a swamp he immediately turned his horse around and caught Brownell's horse.
					</p>
					<p>
					He then retraced his way until he came upon Brownell lying on the ground near a tree. He called out to him, but received no response and so dismounted to check on him. Taking him by the arms and seeing the great amount of blood on the ground, Lawton realized that Thomas Brownell was dead.
					</p>
					<p>
					The following day a coroner's jury, with Samuel Wilbur as foreman, made an inquest into the accident. Testimony was taken from Daniel Lawton and details about the scene of the accident were given.
					</p>
					<p>
					The jury's conclusion was that Brownell, riding furiously down the hill, was either thrown against or hit the tree. The broken reins of his bridle had been found next to the body and there was blood and hair sticking to the tree. His skull was broken and his "brains came out," thus causing his death.
					</p>
