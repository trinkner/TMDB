				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					Thomas Wakely settled in Hingham and Gloucester. He, his wife, his son John and his family, were murdered by Indians in the skirmishes that came to be known as King Philip's War. King Philip was the chief of the Wampanoag Indians and the son of Massasoit, the chief who had befriended the Pilgrims and celebrated the first Thanksgiving in 1620. King Philip resented the intrusion and domination of the colonists and led an uprising of several tribes, including the Narragansetts, in 1675-76, terrorizing New England in what would become known as the bloodiest Indian War ever to take place there. By the time the war ended 52out of 90 New England settlements had been attacked, 12 completely destroyed. King Philip himself was trapped and killed in August 1676.
					</p>
					<p>
					According to the Noyes Family web site, "Thomas with his son John and family, and another son Isaac, and his son-in-law, Matthew Coe, went to Casco Bay, Falmouth, Maine, where they purchased a large tract of land in Back Cove on which they settled and remained until the destruction of the place by the Indians in 1675."
					</p>
					<p>
					William Willis, in his "The History of Portland" gives the following account about Thomas Wakely. "Mather, in his Magnalia, speaking of Thomas Wakely, says, 'Now this honest old man was one who would often say with tears, that he believed God was displeased at him, inasmuch as albeit he came into New England for the sake of the gospel, yet he had left another place in the country where he had enjoyed the gospel in the communion of a gathered church, and now lived many years in a plantation where there was no church at all, nor the ordinances and institutions of the Lord Jesus Christ.'" Willis explained the massacre as follows. "The first visitation of their vengeance was upon the family of Thomas Wakely of Falmouth... This unsuspecting family was composed of Thomas Wakely and his wife, his eldest son, John, his wife, who was far advanced in pregnancy, and their four children. They killed the old man and his wife, his son John and wife, with three children, in a cruel manner, and carried one daughter Elizabeth, about eleven years old, into captivity. Next day Lt. George Ingersoll, who had perceived the smoke repaired to the place with a file of soldiers to learn the cause. He found the body of John's wife and the three children with their brains beaten out lying under some planks, and the half consumed bodies of the old man and his wife near the smoldering ruins of the house. Why this family was selected for a sacrifice we have no means of determining; the Indians committed no further violence, but immediately withdrew to a distant place. The daughter Elizabeth was some months after carried by Squando, the Saco Sachem, to Major Waldron at Dover, where she subsequently married Richard Scamman, a Quaker. The Wakelys came from Cap e Ann, and had originally settled in 1661, at Back Cove, on the west side of Fall Brook, where a son-in-law, Matthew Coe, died. On September 9, 1675, George Ingersol of Capisic Brook in what's now Portland, Maine heard guns go off in the distance in the direction of Casco (now part of Scarborough. ME), and noticed 'great smoke up in the River above Mr. Mackworth's.' He sounded an alarm but could not assemble enough men to investigate safely. The next day, with reinforcements, Ingersol followed the smoke to what had been Thomas Wakely's home. 'When I came to the place, I found an house burnt downe, and six persons killed, and three of the same family could not be found. An old Man and Woman were halfe in, and halfe out of the house near half burnt. Their own Son was shot through the body, and also his head dashed in pieces. This young mans Wife was dead, her head skinned.' The young woman, Ingersol reported, 'was big with Child,' and two of her children, 'haveing their heads dashed in pieces,' were found 'laid by one another with their bellies to the ground, and an Oake planke laid upon their backs.' The three missing family members, Ingersol later discovered had been taken captive."
