				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					Mary Kappes seems to have lived the stereotypically challenging life of a German immigrant who formed the melting pot of America in the middle of the nineteenth century. She left the dwindling opportunity of rural Germany, sailed to America on a cramped steamer, saw her brothers go off to the Civil War nearly as soon as they arrived, joined a thriving German immigrant community in a bustling city in expanding Ohio, suffered the loss of two of her seven children, and finally was left widowed by the death of her husband to tuberculosis when she was only 39. Through all the challenges of her life, she raised her surviving children to adulthood, and watched them attend school in English and become more American than German.
					</p>
					<p>
					Mary was born under her German name, Margaretha Maria Kappes, on 15 April 1850, in the small village of Wertheim, on the Main river in the Grand Duchy of Baden, a recently independent country situated west of Württemberg on the French border. Her father, Peter Kappes, was a carpenter, probably specializing in detailed interior cabinetry. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfathers had all been carpenters as well, all rising to become "schreinermeisteren" or "master carpenters" which implies that they were respected in their profession and likely had apprentices and belonged to a carpenter guild. The Kappes family lived in Wertheim at least as far back as the late 1600s and attended the local Protestant church. Nearly all of Mary's ancestors in Wertheim were village-dwelling families of craftsman, carpenters, river sailors, and blacksmiths.
					</p>
					<p>
					On 15 September 1860, Mary, her older sister Babette, and her mother and father, boarded the "Saxonia" in Hamburg to sail to New York. Sailing against strong westerly gales throughout the passage, the ship stopped briefly at Southampton, England, and then sailed for two weeks toward New York. The Saxonia carried with her reports of the breaking news of impending Italian unification. As they braced against the wind on deck, the Kappeses and their fellow passengers probably discussed these events between discussions of what kind of life might await them in America. The ship was about 300 feet long and 42 feet wide, with a single funnel smoke stack at its center and three masts that could be rigged with sails. It could carry up to about 600 passengers, 450 of them in third class, where immigrants like the Kappeses probably traveled. They arrived in New York on Tuesday, 3 October. The next day the New York Times wrote of the ship's arrival, and with colorful prose recounted the news of Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel's exploits in Italy. Once in Cincinnati, Mary's father set up a shop as a cabinet maker, carrying on the ancedstral tradition of his earlier life in Wertheim.
					</p>
					<p>
					October of 1860 was a tumultuous time in America, just one month before Lincoln was elected president and the southern states declared their secession. The first four years for the Kappes family in America were ones of national upheaval and war, which directly touched their lives. After arriving in the U.S., the family settled in Cincinnati where her parents lived the rest of their lives. Her father found work as a cabinet maker. Her younger brother, Philip, joined the 10th Ohio Infantry, which formed just eight months after the family arrived, and returned a wounded invalid. Family notes suggest that Mary had a second brother whom the notes do not name; a George Kappes, a few years older than Philip, fought in the 78th Ohio Infantry which was stationed in Cincinnati for a few months in 1862 before seeing action in Tennessee.
					</p>
					<p>
					After the war ended, Mary met Paul F. Trinkner, who had arrived from Germany with his family in June, 1865. She married him in 1868, and moved to Cleveland where the rest of his family were living. They almost certainly spoke German in their home, as Paul had only been in America for three years before they married, and they likely spent much of their time within the close German immigrant community in Cleveland. Economically, Mary and Paul seemed to have succeeded, as by 1900 Mary owned her own home, but they probably were of humble means. Paul never found a consistent career, and the jobs which he worked were not high-paying ones. He seems never to have had a job that lasted more than a few years, perhaps because he was restless or because he tried new opportunities as they came along. He worked as an upholsterer and for a family-run furniture store, before working as a bartender and finally a harness maker. Mary and Paul lived in Cleveland for the rest of their lives. Two years after they were married, in 1870, Mary became a U.S. citizen.
					</p>
					<p>
					Throughout her adult life, Mary worked as a homemaker. She and Paul had seven children, five of whom survived to adulthood. In 1890, when he was only 42, Paul died of tuberculosis, a disease that at the time caused more than 10% of the deaths in Cleveland. After his death, Mary lived for a few years in the house that they had purchased at 330 "C" Street. She continued to pay a mortgage, probably with the help of three of her children, Julius, Edward, and Elsie, who lived with her at least until 1900 as young, employed adults. By 1910, she had moved to live with her daughter, Elsie and Elsie's husband, William Fording, with whom she lived until she died of heart failure in 1920.
					</p>
					<p>
					By the time that she died, five of her seven children had survived. All had attended school, and likely spoke English better than they spoke German. Her children lived during a peaceful time, and probably experienced few of the hardships akin to those her family experienced during their immigration and life during the Civil War.
