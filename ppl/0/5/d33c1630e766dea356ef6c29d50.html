				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					From the History of Tioga County, which mentions a William Ward who came from New York and bought land in Tioga county. We know that John G. Ward was born in New York state, although he raised his family initially in Pennsylvania
					</p>
					<p>
					"The survey of Capt. John Bortle's pitch began "near a sugar-house on the northerly side of Towanda creek," and bounded on the east by the west line of Claverack, and contained 1500 acres. The Pennsylvania owners were the Asylum company and Joseph Priestly, of Northumberland. A part of the Holland's company's purchase extended into this township. This company, which was composed of the same individuals that formed the company which figured so largely in the settlement of western New York, owned ten tracts of land in Bradford County, which is in Albany, Monroe and Asylum townships. William Ward, Esq., was the agent for the company in Pennsylvania, and afterwards bought the residue of their lands in Bradford County."
					</p>
					<p>
					-------------------
					</p>
					<p>
					From the "History of the Seneca Baptist Association" by Lewis Halsey, 1879.
					</p>
					<p>
					1815: "They voted to raise two hundred dollars for the expenses for the year, and appointed Jesse Hall, Samual Almy, Lewis Johnston, William Ward, Joshua Gee, Josiah Cleveland and Chester Coburn as solicitors, each to collect his subscriptions and to receive five percent for his trouble."
					</p>
					<p>
					"On 9th of Nov. 1817, it was resolved to set apart brethren William Ward, Elnathan Winans and Lewis Johnston, to serve as church deacons."
					</p>
					<p>
					"Deacons: William Ward, Josiah Cleveland, and Samuel Gregory, elected Sept 16, 1820;"
					</p>

					From Janet Cornell, via email, 15 April 2007:
					</p>
					<p>
					Hi Richard,
					</p>
					<p>
					I saw your Rootsweb entry for the names of Henry Tompkins, Samantha<br />
					Ward, his mother, and then for John &amp; William Ward. These names are all<br />
					part of my William Ward family. That was very interesting information<br />
					about Henry Tompkins. You obviously have first hand information. How<br />
					are you related to this family? I had been trying to locate Helen R.<br />
					Teal Grubel as she once lived in Mentor, OH which is my residence but she<br />
					evidently doesn't live here any more.
					</p>
					<p>
					As a point of information your John G. Ward and William Ward are the same<br />
					names in my records but your information is different from mine.
					</p>
					<p>
					My William Ward was born circa 1770. His place of birth is uncertain.<br />
					The 1850 Mortality Schedule of Crawford Co., PA where William Ward died<br />
					lists New York as place of birth. The 1880 Mortality schedule for his<br />
					son, Israel Ward, lists Ireland as place of birth. William's wife is<br />
					Phebe (from property records both in Tompkins Co., NY and Crawford Co.,<br />
					PA where he lived). William was a Deacon in the Baptist Church of<br />
					Ulysses, NY having been chosen Sept. 16, 1820 (page 541, History of<br />
					Seneca, Tompkins &amp; Schuyler Counties, NY). He was also an early member<br />
					of the Baptist congregation located one mile west of Linesville, PA<br />
					(Crawford Co., PA History, p 593). It has been handed down in the family<br />
					that some of the Ward family were Tories and in the War of 1812 they lost<br />
					their land and were sent back to England.
					</p>
					<p>
					William leaves a will naming his children: William, John Garrison, Lewis,<br />
					Israel, Joseph, Benjamin, Betsy &amp; Patty. My line is through Israel who<br />
					was also a deacon in the Baptist church as was his son Isaac. John<br />
					Garrison Ward was born Apr. 4, 1799 in NY and came with his father and<br />
					family to Crawford Co., PA about 1823. He purchased 14 acres in Crawford<br />
					Co. in 1828 and sold this same land in 1837. He is next found in the<br />
					1840, 50, 60 and 70 census of Berwick Twp., Warren Co., IL. Information<br />
					on this family was provided by a descendant Luster &amp; Nina Pool in a<br />
					letter dated July 14, 1987, Springfield, MO. Luster's great grandfather<br />
					was Amos Pool who married Clara Eliza Ward, John G.'s daughter. Amos<br />
					Pool was also from Crawford Co., PA. John G. Ward was a Baptist preacher<br />
					as you know. John G's wife Harriet St. John evidently lived near the<br />
					Ward's in Seneca Co., NY as there is a Jacob St. John living next to<br />
					William Ward in early census records. It seems to all fit.
					</p>
					<p>
					I am in the process of completing my work on the Ward family and plan to<br />
					place a copy of the history in the Crawford Co., PA Genealogical Society<br />
					library in Meadville, PA so that the information is not lost forever. I<br />
					think this William Ward is correct because of his wife Phebe's name<br />
					showing up in property records both in NY and in Crawford Co., PA....<br />
					also because of the Baptist Church connection for family members.
					</p>
					<p>
					If you are interested in additional details of this family let me know.<br />
					My mother was a Ward, thus the interest in the family. Do you have any<br />
					information on Henry Tompkins' brother William? I have some information<br />
					on Cora Tompkins Ballou but would like more.
					</p>

					<p>
					From Crawford County, Pennsylvania History &amp; Biography 1885, "Township Histories." &lt;page 586&gt;
					</p>
					<p>
					from the chapter on Pine Township:
					</p>
					<p>
					"The Baptist congregation in 1852 erected the first church edifice in Linesville. A society of this denomination flourished in pioneer times and worshiped in a log meeting-house which stood on the knoll near the cemetery, about a mile east of Linesville. Rev. McMillan held services here as early as 1818, and among the early members were William Ward, James Bishop, Moses Bishop, Sr., and William Bunnell. The society was maintained for many years. About 1846 a branch of the Georgetown Baptist Church was organized at Linesville and remained in active existence until the present Baptist congregation was organized March 11, 1851, with eighteen members by Rev. E. M. Alden. The frame church building, erected the year following, is located on East Main Street and cost about $2,500. The first Deacons were Israel Ward and William Porter, one of the earliest Clerks, Stephen Bunnell. The present Clerk is B. O. Irons; the present Deacons: William Porter, I. E. Ward and B. O. Irons. Succeeding Elder Alden the following among others have been the Pastors: Revs. J. G. Whitney, O. N. Ney, Fuller, John Hicks, C. H. Fuller, Mills, L. R. Jayne, C. H. Johnson, E. M. Alden and C. T. Jack, the present pastor. The membership is about 130."

					From Janet Cornell, in an email from 15 Apr 2008
					</p>
					<p>
					There is little doubt that William &amp; family had settled in Ulysses, Seneca Co., NY in 1809. Ulysses Co. became a part of Tompkins Co., in 1817. Two boundaries of William's property on Lot #1 are beach trees with 1809 W.W. carved into them (from property deeds) It is assumed this is the year he purchased the land in Ulysses. William Ward and Phebe his wife sold this land Dec. 31, 1821 to Alexander Rosengrant of Ovid for $954.04, Lot # 1 in Ulysses. William was of Covert, Seneca County at this time.
					</p>
					<p>
					1810 census Ulysses, Seneca Co., NY, p 164 A lists:
					</p>
					<p>
					4 males 0 - 10 Lewis, Israel, Benjamin &amp; Joseph<br />
					2 males 10 - 16 John G. &amp; unknown male<br />
					1 male 16 - 26 William Jr.<br />
					1 male over 45 William Sr.
					</p>
					<p>
					2 females 0 - 10 Betsy &amp; Patty perhaps<br />
					1 female 16 - 26 unknown female<br />
					1 female 26 - 45 Phebe
					</p>
					<p>
					1810 census Ulysses also has a Jacob Ward... perhaps a brother.
					</p>
					<p>
					William Ward is in the 1820 census of Covert, Seneca Co., NY. There is a William Ward Jr. living next door to him in this 1820 census.
					</p>
					<p>
					Next William Ward bought property Jan. 12, 1823 in Crawford Co., PA from John Gilliand and wife Fanny. William is living in Sadsbury Twp., Crawford Co., PA and he paid $600 for the land. In 1825 William Ward and wife Phebe Ward sold 40 acres of land to Alanson Porter in Sadsbury recorded in 1830. Records suggest that most if not all his children moved with him to Crawford Co., PA. There is another William Ward in Sadsbury Twp but have not been able to prove he is the son of William Sr. Freeman Bunnell is also there in 1830 &amp; 1840 census.
					</p>
					<p>
					William died April 1850 of dropsy ( from 1850 mortality schedule) He had been ill for 56 days. He was age 80.
					</p>
					<p>
					William's will was signed Aug. 14, 1849 and probated May 10, 1850. From the Gilliland-Ward family Bible William died April 20, 1850. He leaves:
					</p>
					<p>
					1. $5 to be equally divided between his lawful heirs.
					</p>
					<p>
					2. His son Israel Ward the farm which he now resides as long as Israel &amp; his wife shall live.
					</p>
					<p>
					3. After the death of Israel &amp; his wife, the farm shall go to John Stanley Ward &amp; Martha Ann Ward, grandchildren by his twin sons, Joseph and Benjamin, deceased.
					</p>
					<p>
					4. Alvina, Widow of Benjamin and her daughter, Martha, shall have a home with Israel as long as she shall remain a widow.
					</p>
					<p>
					5. John S. shall live with Israel during his years of minority and shall keep the property left him by his father consisting of bed, bedding, chest, trunk and clothing and shall have out of William's personal property one cow and five sheep.
					</p>
					<p>
					6. Remaining property goes to living children: Lewis, John, William Jr., Betsy Hinkly wife of Joshua Hinkly, Patty Bunnell wife of Freeman Bunnell &amp; Israel Ward.
					</p>
					<p>
					7. Israel Ward is named executor and it was witnessed by James Goring and Seth Gilliland.
					</p>
					<p>
					The only thing I have on William Tompkins is that he was born circa 1858 in Galesburg, Knox County, IL. In 1905 when his mother died he was of Kansas City. He may have worked for the railroad also. I might have some later census entries for him.
					</p>
					<p>
					Cora Tompkins Ballou lived in Galesburg, IL with her husband Fremont Charles Ballou who was a barber. He died Dec. 18, 1906 after a four hour illness from an attack of acute indigestion. He was survived by his wife Cora and son Percy. Cora &amp; Percy are next found living in Erie, PA where Percy is working as an accountant for the New York Central Railroad. Percy signed his draft notice for WWI June 5, 1917 in Erie, PA. He says he was the sole support of his mother so probably did not serve. Percy was born Sept. 2, 1891. This is all I have on them. Can't locate them in 1920 census.
					</p>
					<p>
					Hope this all makes sense to you. Talk to you again.
					</p>
					<p>
					Bye,
					</p>
					<p>

					William seems to have settled in Linesville, Crawford, PA. From "History of Crawford County, Pennsylvania" published by Warner, Beers &amp; Co. in 1885:
					</p>
					<p>
					"The Baptist congregation in 1852 erected the first church edifice in Linesville. A society of this denomination flourished in pioneer times and worshipped in a log meeting-house which stood on the knoll near the cemetery, about a mile east of Linesville. Rev.
