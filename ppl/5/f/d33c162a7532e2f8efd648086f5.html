				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					The name of Walter Power appears on the Middlesex County records of 1654 as a boy 14 years old, (DOB1639-Essex England ), later know as Kinsale County Cork, Ireland, and he married 11 Jan 1660 to Trial, daughter of Decon Ralph and Thankes, or sometimes written, Thankeslord Sheppard. Rev. Grant Powers of Goshen, Conn, has left a manuscript record from information said to have been obtained from his grandmother, the widow of Capt. Peter Powers of Hollis, N.H., that Walter landed at Salem in 1654, and that he married Trial, the daughter of a London goldsmith.
					</p>
					<p>
					At this time, little is known of Walter Power, but probably he had not received advantages of much early education, but depended upon strong sinews and sterling good sense to establish a home for himself and his family. Trial, his wife, seems to have been a woman of some education and from the position which his sons took in the affairs of the town, etc.,we may presume they were family educated for the times.
					</p>
					<p>
					Walter and "Triall his wife' were "convicted of fornication by them committed together before marriage." They were sentenced to be flogged.Trial's dad bought her out of the flogging by paying a fine in lieu of her flogging. Walter was sentenced " to be openly whipt with 15 stripes by the constable of Cambridge".
					</p>
					<p>
					According to Amos Powers, author of "The Powers family:a genealogicaland historical record of Walter Power and some of his descendants to the ninth generation," not much is known of Walter:
					</p>
					<p>
					At the time of their marriage, Walter and his wife settled on a tractof land in or near Concord, which took the name of Concord Village, now in the town of Littleton, and adjoining the Indian town of Nashobe, which Deacon Ralph Sheppard bought of Lieut. Joseph Wheeler, and built his house on the north side of Quagany Hill, about half a mile from the garrison house and less distant than that from Nagog pong, the site of which may still be discovered by the slight depression of the cellar.
					</p>
					<p>
					In 1694, Walter Power bought of Thomas Waban and other Indians, one-fourth part of the township of Nashobe. His remains were doubtless buried in the old "Powers' burying-ground," as also were those of his wife, who survived him many years, but just how long is not known. (From Amos Powers, author of "The Powers family:a genealogical and historical record of Walter Power and some of his descendants to the ninth generation" )
