				<h4>Narrative</h4>
				<div class="grampsstylednote">
					<p>
					The story of Philip Austin Thompson is an action-packed sampling of the larger-than-life events of America in the mid-1800s. He lived through the settling of new territory and birth of a state, journeyed across the western desert and Sierra Nevadas to the California gold rush before the railroad, was a leading member of the new anti-slavery Republican party in a slave state, witnessed his community torn by the passions of the South's secession, rose from obscurity to become a Lieutenant Colonel in the Civil War, had two horses shot from beneath him as he fought pro-slavery guerrillas in Missouri, helped spread the railroad westward, grew wealthy as a cattle rancher and banker, served as a state senator, and lost his wealth suddenly before the 1890 depression. His life was a testament to how far a man with little education, but with good fortune and ambition, could succeed and prosper in the newly developing Midwest. Despite living only to the relatively young age of 58, he influenced these national and local events, achieved great admiration in his community, and fathered nine children who loved him deeply.
					</p>
					<p>
					Philip Austin Thompson was the son of David Hamilton Thompson, who was a native of Tennessee. His mother, formerly Annie Williams, was born in St. Louis County, Missouri. They settled in Missouri, a northern state with southern-leaning culture, before it was admitted into the Union. After they lived for some years in Callaway County, Philip, the second of nine children, was born on July 21, 1830, ten years after Missouri was admitted controversially to the Union as a slave state. His adult life would be heavily affected by the conflict over slavery in Missouri and the western territories.
					</p>
					<p>
					Though formally named Philip, his family and friends nicknamed him "Aus" after his middle name. His education probably lasted only through his adolescence, but he learned enough to hold several academic careers, including working as a bookkeeper, teacher, politician, and banker. At the age of eighteen years he entered a store in DeKalb, Buchanan County, as a salesman and bookkeeper. He had hoped to study law, but he never pursued this course, perhaps due to lack of funds. He remained in DeKalb until 1851, when time he moved to Holt County and taught school for one year. In 1852, he traveled to the newly admitted state of California and lived there three years, engaged in farming. In 1855, he returned to Holt County, Missouri. Fast-western Missouri in 1855 must have been an interesting place and time to live, as immediately across the county line was the Kansas-Nebraska territory, which was embroiled in a bloody conflict between free-soilers and pro-slavery families over the future legality of slavery in the territories acquired after the Mexican-American war.
					</p>
					<p>
					In 1856 Aus began a merchandising business in Rock Port, Atchison County, in connection with Messrs. Dillon and Ruland, under the firm name of Dillon, Thompson &amp; Co., which continued until 1859. That year he entered into partnership with Dr. Richard Buckham, whose daughter Susan caught Aus's eye, and they married on December 31, 1859. Their marriage was strong and devoted for the 29 years they had together before Aus died. They had 10 children between 1859 and 1879. Susan lived to be 91, outliving some of her children and dying in Atchison county in 1930.
					</p>
					<p>
					In the months before the Civil War, Missouri was a society sadly divided over slavery and loyalty to the Union. Even though Aus was known as a Unionist, southern sympathizers came by the house to pay their respects to him and Susan before the state would be fraught with strife and guerrilla warfare. When the war began, Aus closed his store and joined the Union side of the State Militia, enlisting at first for six months. He was elected major of the Fourth Battalion, a position he held until his time had closed. At the expiration of his term of service, he re-enlisted for three more years, in the Fifth Cavalry, and was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the regiment. His superior officer was Colonel Penick, whom Aus must have respected greatly, as he named one of his daughters Eda Penick. The Fifth Cavalry was organized at St. Joseph, Missouri during March and April, 1862. It saw duty in central Missouri, including operations in Carroll, Ray and Livingston Counties July 27-August 4, 1862; Grand River August 1, 1862; near Barry Section August 14, 1862; Iron County September 11, 1862; Liberty and Sibley's Landing, October 6, 1862; California House, October 18, 1862; and Independence, February 3, 1863.
					</p>
					<p>
					The two regiments that Aus commanded chiefly fought against guerrilla forces in central Missouri. With most Union troops occupied in fighting against Confederate forces further south, loosely organized Confederate raiders terrorized central Missouri behind the lines. The most famous of these guerrillas was William Quantrill, whose band was later named the Quantrill Raiders. The outlaws Jessie James and his brother Frank James, both from Missouri, were slave-owning Confederates who fought in Quantrill's band against Aus's regiments. Aus would have been very personally motivated for the regiment to succeed, as his home in Atchison was on the Kansas border and would have felt constantly threatened by Quantrill's soldiers. In 1863, Quantrill executed 200 townspeople in Lawrence, Kansas, only about 100 miles from Aus's home. Quantrill was never captured or killed in Missouri, but his forces were finally expelled from the state.
					</p>
					<p>
					In all battles, 21 of Aus's enlisted were men killed and mortally wounded. In addition, one officer and 47 enlisted men died by disease. His regiment was mustered out of service in February 1863.
					</p>
					<p>
					During his tenure as colonel, Aus worked to establish a Republican-oriented newspaper in Rock Port to create pro-Union sentiment. He was a founding owner of the Atchison County Journal, and frequently wrote and edited the weekly paper. In 1915, the paper wrote of his role in founding the paper in 1862, stating "Col. Thompson was an excellent editor, and his political articles were always excellent reading, and he was as good a reporter of local events and matters of person interest. He was a born leader and his influence extended all over Northwest Missouri and outside of party lines. He believed in honest politics and put his beliefs into practices. There are men of all political parties still living in Atchison county who will bear witness that to his work on The Journal during the two or three first years of its existence, as well as his advance to and council with the people, resulted in a great measure to restoring peace and quiet in the county, and saved many lives and much property. The Journal was fulfilling its mission of 'creating Union sentiment.'"
					</p>
					<p>
					After the war, Aus returned to his mercantile pursuits in Rock Port, having his brother, F. P. Thompson, as his associate, in April, 1867. In 1868 the business house was removed to Phelps City. In March 1875, he began a general banking business which also served as a local security broker. He also continued as a farmer, operating one of the largest towns in the area. He annually fed and shipped a large quantity of live stock. As a farmer, he grew gain, especially wheat, and operated a large wheat dealership.
					</p>
					<p>
					During these years after the war, he and his wife began to buy property in Templeton, Missouri, acquiring contiguous parcels in 1867, 1868, and 1870, until their farm totaled 700 acres. They built the large country house known as the "Thompson--Campbell Farmstead" which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. According to a memoir written by Aus's wife Susan, the new railroad came through the Thompson land the following year in 1868. Thompson gave the railroad the right of way and in return, a platform and switch were put in on his land, Thompson's Switch, to facilitate his grain dump, stockyard, and grain dealership business. This switch was named Langdon, which has since grown into a town. The Thompson family lived in a frame house on their farmstead until the brick house was completed in 1871.
					</p>
					<p>
					Susan later wrote about the large brick house in her memoir. "It had 14 large rooms and we needed them all, for by that time we had six children. We had four children later my daughter Eda was the first born in the brick. When the brick was ready for us 'Aus' came in one day and said that we could move the next day. The next day was Friday and I was always superstitious about beginning anything on Friday. To rid ourselves of a possible jinx, we started moving that very afternoon, and by night we were pretty well moved. We moved to the brick in 1871 and lived there until we moved to Rock Port a little over five years after Aus died."
					</p>
					<p>
					The new house was built for $13,000. Its Italianate influence was certainly designed not only to hold the growing family, but to show the wealth and prominence of the family. Replacement farmhouses would often resemble the high-style mansions seen in towns and cities. These houses, however, only approximated their urban counterparts in scale, plan and elaborate ornament. The Thompson-Campbell house, as an excellent vernacular interpretation of the Italianate style, was a showpiece that demonstrated the status of the family. The house was prominently sited and drew comments in every published history of Atchison County. Aus had achieved social standing within his community and the house's Italianate style, relatively new to the area, would have conveyed his importance to the rest of the county. Due to the rural setting and local construction methods, the design was restricted to a simple, boxy design, but the brackets, massing, windows and interior details are typical of Italianate houses based on the late Georgian period. The wide eaves supported by brackets, hooded windows, chamfered bay and balustraded porch would have most clearly identified Thompson's house as a high-style Italianate structure for the region.
					</p>
					<p>
					In politics, Aus was a Whig as long as that party was in existence into the late 1850s, after which he became a Republican. Missouri in the 1850s was a state divided over the use of slavery in the U.S. Although slavery was legal in Missouri after 1820, the state chose to remain loyal to the Union during the Civil War. The southern portions had more slave ownership than the northern portions. Aus lived in Atchison county, which is in the extreme north-west of the state, immediately next to the Nebraska border. In 1860, 820 families lived in Atchison county, but only 29 of them owned slaves. Aus was not a slave owner and, since he belonged to the anti-slavery Republican party, he likely opposed slavery. In 1870 he was elected treasurer of Atchison County. In 1873 he was elected to fill a vacancy in the state senate from the district composed of Atchison, Holt, and Nodaway Counties, and at the end of two years declined a re-election. In the fall of 1874, he was nominated by the Republicans of the Ninth Congressional District, for a seat in congress. Though defeated, 55% to 44%, he ran five hundred ahead of his ticket, in his own county, thus showing the esteem in which he was held.
					</p>
					<p>
					Sadly, just before his death prior to the financial panic and the depression of the 1890s Aus had dissolved a business partnership with another man but failed to publish articles and notices of dissolution; shortly thereafter, the firm went bankrupt, and he was held legally liable for half the indebtedness, and lost practically everything.
					</p>
					<p>
					Aus was a member of the Blue Lodge, and a member and Past High priest of the Royal Arch Chapter, while it was at Phelp City. He was also an active Odd Fellow. He was a supporter of the Christian Church, of the Disciples of Christ. His faith, and that of the family as a whole, must have been quite strong, as his daughter, Eda Penick, later married Erastus Moore, a minister of the Disciples of Christ, and worked devotedly as an administrative evangelist for the faith.
					</p>
					<p>
					Aus lived his later years in the house he had built, surrounded by his family of nine children, enjoying the confidence and respect of his fellow citizens. Toward the end of his life, he was totally blind, due to rheumatism and heart disease, which he said he contracted in early 1863 during the war. He died in 1888, only 58 years old.
