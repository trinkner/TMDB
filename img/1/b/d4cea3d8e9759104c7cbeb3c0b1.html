					From an email from Doug Rivard, May 2016
					</p>
					<p>
					This is the only known picture of the Trinkner Homestead. I have copies of the Homestead docs in my files that I dug up at the Pinal County Courthouse. It was taken from an altar built on a hill (I've stood on the spot). The cross from the altar was on the wall of a cousin's house last I heard. The structure on the right is the 2 room adobe Charlie built. The other is probably a barn. The animals were kept close in the pens you see because the Apaches were still a big threat for another 15 years or so. In the foreground out of frame is the water tank and windmill Charlie built. It had a pipe running to the house which is not in the picture so the pic must predate the pipe. I wish I knew who the person standing on the left in front of the corral is! The original of this pic was in the home of Albert Ruiz (Charlie's grandson) and patriarch of the family. He died a few years ago and I do not know where the pic has ended up.
					</p>
					<p>
					The homestead is Haystack Valley in Cottonwood District. It is now part of a ranch known as Willow Springs. It is just SE of the Barkerville downside and about 3 miles NW of the Kimbro Ranch where my great-grandmother was raised. She  used to ride a burro with her siblings to the Homestead and then her cousins would ride along to the school at Barkerville.
					</p>
					<p>
					When Charlie died Pasquala moved to Hayden and his oldest daughter and her husband took over the Homestead and it became known as "the Ruiz". It is still referred to this on maps.
					</p>
					<p>
					For many centuries native Americans migrated through the area. There are mortar holes for grinding mesquite beans all around the Ranch. Victoria (Charlie's 2nd youngest and my 3rd great grandmother) would always allow the Apache's to water and stay the night at the Kimbro Ranch. This was from around 1904 to the 1930s. They would leave in the dark without making a sound and always leave a gift in way of thanks. The spring at the Ranch was the only in the area that didn't dry up in the summer.
